# CryptoClustering
I am glad that I am catching up with the course even though it is not on a fast pace, but I can do some work independently. 
This CryptoClustering challenge has been a little difficult as few others but I was able to do some of the work independently with the help of examples from our lecture activities. I am glad that I am learning gradually.
My instructors, TA, and class mates were able to help me with things I wasn't sure about. I was able to use ChatGPT as well in completing this challenge.
